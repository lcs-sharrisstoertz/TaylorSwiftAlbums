Swift confronts media scrutiny and public perception while also showcasing her vulnerability in tracks about love and resilience. Reputation marks a turning point in her career, symbolizing her reclaiming of narrative control and personal growth.")

let folklore = Album(image: "house", albumName: "Folklore", description: "Taylor Swift's Folklore, released in 2020, is a critically acclaimed, introspective departure into indie-folk and alternative music. Characterized by poetic storytelling and stripped-down instrumentation, the album explores themes of love, loss, and nostalgia through fictional narratives and personal reflections. Featuring hits like Cardigan and Exile (featuring Bon Iver), Folklore showcases Swift's artistry and lyrical depth in a subdued, contemplative tone. It earned widespread acclaim, including the Grammy for Album of the Year, cementing her versatility as a songwriter and musician.")
